<h2>Executive Summary</h2>

<p>Leveraging BigQuery and Looker Studio, our project aims to answer a crucial business question: “How can the NYPD work in tandem with NYC public stakeholders to minimize the impact of collisions?” Using analytical techniques including descriptive analytics and time series forecasting, we extrapolate the patterns and behaviours across time, locations, vehicle type and driver errors. Our comprehensive analysis not only offers historical facts on time and geographic locations involving more accidents, but also enables data-informed predictions and public intervention strategies for the near future.</p>

<p>Key findings from our dashboard highlight hotspots and peak times for accidents, informing targeted road safety campaigns and immediate emergency response planning. The dashboard's actionable insights facilitate the implementation of a dual-defense strategy: to spread powerful messages of road safety practices to the greater public and to ensure the public department can respond swiftly to emergencies.</p>

<p>Success of this initiative will be measured through tangible metrics, such as a decrease in casualty rate, heightened public engagement with safety campaigns, and improved response efficiencies, ensuring a safer NYC. Our project represents a significant step forward in data-driven public safety management, setting a new standard for urban traffic safety initiatives.</p>
